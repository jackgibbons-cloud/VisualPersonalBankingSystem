Yes, the PBS from its humble beginnings in 1981 as a ZX80 program to handle your finances has moved on to new heights...

The all new PC version has now grown Windows (3.xx, 9x or NT) and stores all your transactions in a database managed by the Microsoft Jet engine.  So not only do you have a simple and friendly user interface but you have speedy operation and almost unlimited number of accounts and transactions.  A boon for keeping a rolling 22 months or more of detailed records for the tax man!

The Visual PBS is now truly multi-currency: so whether you hold your cash in Deutsche Marks, Pesetas, Euros or just English Pounds, it is all taken care of - simply.  Dates are now millennium compatible to take you into the 21st century without fuss.

All types of accounts can be maintained e.g. Bank, Building Society and Credit Card with standing order transfers between accounts in addition to the existing account transfer facility.  The Visual PBS now processes all your accounts, both personal and business, simultaneously, so your finances are always up to date, which is more than you can say for your bank statement. 

Comprehensive Budgeting enables you to track income against expenditure, across multiple accounts, to get a clearer picture of where the money goes, either on a month by month or accumulative basis.

Standing orders and direct debits/credits are processed automatically for any frequency (including daily, weekly, lunar monthly, in addition to monthly, quarterly, six monthly and annually) and for a set number of payments. Coupled with forward projections, easy bank reconciliation with full summary, search and flexible enquiry facilities with comprehensive analysis, the PBS puts you firmly in control of your money.

Here we have the Visual Personal Banking System for Windows 10, written with Visual Basic 2019, .NetFrameWork v4.0, MS Access 2, Crystal Reports 5.0 (which likes the databases and Crystal.rpt formats in the local C:\VPBS folder!). New for this version is Automatic Bank Reconciliation. Makes the task of reconciling your Bank Statement a doddle.
